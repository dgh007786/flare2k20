## Flare 20 Website Components

This document outlines key interactive components of the Flare 20 website, designed to provide a rich user experience.

## Navigation Sidebar

- **Description**: The sidebar (`#sidenav`) is a vertical menu that provides navigation links to different parts of the website. It is accessible via a hamburger menu icon and can be closed with a custom-designed close button (`&times;`).
  
- **Functionality**: Implemented with JavaScript, the sidebar offers a smooth slide-in effect, enhancing the mobile user experience.

- **Styling**: CSS is used to style the sidebar, ensuring it matches the theme of the event and provides an intuitive interface for users.

## Parallax Scrolling

- **Description**: The parallax effect is created using multiple background layers that move at different speeds (`par_layer`), producing a three-dimensional scrolling effect.

- **Interactivity**: As the user scrolls down the page, the background images move to create an illusion of depth, making the website feel more dynamic.

- **Implementation**: This feature is implemented using JavaScript and CSS. The movement of each layer is controlled by the `data-speed` attribute, which defines the speed of the parallax effect relative to the scroll.

## Meet The Team

- **Description**: The 'Meet The Team' section (`ourteam`) introduces the team members with interactive profile cards.

- **Features**:
  - Clickable cards flip to reveal contact information and a brief bio.
  - Hover animations enhance interactivity.

- **Customization**: JavaScript functions enable switching between team member details without reloading the page, and CSS transitions provide smooth animation effects.

## Events Page

- **Description**: The Events page (`events`) lists the schedule of the fest, organized by day and time.

- **Details**:
  - Each event has a dedicated section with a description, venue, and timing.
  - Users can click on an event to get a detailed overview, including images and additional information.

- **Navigation**: Custom JavaScript is used to navigate between different event days, improving user experience by eliminating the need to load new pages.
